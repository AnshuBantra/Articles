**Abheeti's 21st Birthday**

Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,

Thanks to all of you for taking out this time today to be a part of this celebration, much appriciated. 

As we gather here today, I stand before you with a heart full of pride and a wallet that's considerably lighter, thanks to the 21 years of raising this incredible young woman standing beside me. Yes, my daughter, Abheeti, is now 21, and I'm still trying to figure out how she managed to age so gracefully while I ended up with these gray, oh sorry, no hair.

When Abheeti was born and my brave wife was bearing all the pain while I was having anxiety attacks of becoming a father, outside the OT. I was thinking and rethinking is I was prepared for everything. Little did I know that 'everything' included surviving sleepless nights, deciphering teenage slang, and learning to text with more than just my index finger and moving to Australia. But look at her now, all grown up and still thinking I have no idea what ‘LOL’ means.

Abheeti, you've always been my little girl, even though you now tower over me in those heels. You've taught me so much over the years, like patience, especially when waiting for you to get ready to go out. And let’s not forget the art of negotiation, which usually ends with you getting your way.

But in all seriousness, you are the light of my life. Your compassion, intelligence, and wit are qualities that make you the extraordinary person you are (I did not say laziness, did I ). You've faced challenges with courage and have shown kindness that knows no bounds. You are of the generation who will in the future , tell kids how you spent the two most gorgeous year of high school at home looking at your  pop's working from home in his pyjamas. I am in awe of the woman you’ve become.

So, as you step into adulthood, officially, remember that life is a beautiful journey. There will be highs and lows, and it is these higs & lows which make the life worthwhile, else it would be too boring and predictable. Always accept the challenges and never stop dreaming and then pursuing your dreams. Keep your head high, your spirits higher, and your phone charged – because I always have to know where you are, probably most when you least expect it.

Happy 21st Birthday, my princess (I mean eldest pricess Aaru, you too are, no offence)! Here's to you – may your sense of humor, strength of character and your education & abilities take you to places and achieve your dreams. And remember, no matter how old you get, you’ll always be my little girl.

Cheers!
